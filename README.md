## Repository Description

OpenTofu **example** module for a Google Cloud Platform cloud SQL instance.

## 🔩 Usage

> [!TIP]
> You can check the [tests/fixtures](tests/fixtures) directory for example configurations. These fixtures set up the system for testing by providing all the necessary initial code, thus creating good examples on which to base your configurations.

Google project services must be enabled before using this module. As a best practice, these should be defined in the [pt-arche-google-project](https://github.com/osinfra-io/pt-arche-google-project) module. The following services are required:

- `sqladmin.googleapis.com`
- `servicenetworking.googleapis.com`

## 🛠️ Tools

- [osinfra-pre-commit-hooks](https://github.com/osinfra-io/pt-techne-pre-commit-hooks)
- [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)

## 📋 Skills and Knowledge

Links to documentation and other resources required to develop and iterate in this repository successfully.

- [cloud sql](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs)

## 🔍 Tests

All tests are [mocked](https://opentofu.org/docs/cli/commands/test/#the-mock_provider-blocks) allowing us to test the module without creating infrastructure or requiring credentials. The trade-offs are acceptable in favor of speed and simplicity. In an OpenTofu test, a mocked provider or resource will generate fake data for all computed attributes that would normally be provided by the underlying provider APIs.

```none
tofu init

```none
